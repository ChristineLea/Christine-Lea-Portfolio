# Christine Lea Portfolio

## Description

This project has been created as a way to showcase my skills and talents and has
been created from scratch. As I progress through my course and learn new
technologies and programming languages I will continue to update my portfolio
projects. Employer's can view an **About Me** section, my **Portfolio**, as well
as my **Contact** details and current **Resume**.

_How can I structure my portfolio to ensure that it showcases my current
abilities as I have very few projects to incorporate?_ I have added some
addition creativity, such as a progress bar to show how close I am to being a
full stack web developer, as well as projects which are _Under Construction_.

## Installation

installation.
